## Project: NBA Playoff Prediction



##### Abstract                                                                                       

Machine learning algorithms with predictive analytics has become a key to fully understand how things work in different fields, and further a key to sustainable developments and improvements. This project presents a comparative study between two supervised learning algorithm (Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) in big data, in an attempt to make predictions based on basketball statistics. The project team is going to gather data of the general statistics of the basketball teams in the regular NBA season  in order to predict is going to make it to the playoff or not.
