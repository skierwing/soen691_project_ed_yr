##### Abstract                                                                                       

Machine learning algorithms with predictive analytics has become a key to fully understand how things work in different fields, and further a key to sustainable developments and improvements. This project presents a comparative study between two supervised learning algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) in big data, to make predictions based on basketball statistics. This project is going to gather quantitative data of the general statistics of the basketball teams in the regular NBA season. Then based on the quantitative analysis of classifiers studied the algorithms used will predict if a team is going to make it to the playoff or not.
