project description :

Using The dataset of "NBA Players stats since 1950" found on Kaggle website, we intend to determine 
the position a player belongs to and how much 3 points is he going to score.

we are going to filter the data to start from 2005.

Our data shall be separated into training sets (likely 90% of our data) and testing sets (the
other 10%). 

Our primary classifier shall be a Naive Bayes classifier we shall train using part of our data, 
and use to make predictions to be verified against our test data.
